## 🌟 Core Features

-   **📄 Dual NDA Types**: Generate both **One-Way** and **Mutual** NDAs to cover different business scenarios.
-   **✏️ Fully Customizable**: Dynamically input party names, effective dates, confidentiality duration, and the specific scope of information to be protected.
-   **🚀 Instant Generation**: Create a complete, professionally formatted NDA document with a single click.
-   **📋 Easy to Use**: Copy the generated text to your clipboard or simulate a `.DOCX` download for immediate use.
-   **🌌 Immersive UI/UX**: Enjoy a clean, intuitive interface set against a stunning, animated galaxy background that makes a serious task feel frictionless.
-   **📱 Responsive Design**: A flawless experience across all devices, from large desktops to mobile phones.
-   **📈 SEO Optimized**: Features a comprehensive 3500+ word article on NDAs and includes full JSON-LD schema to ensure high visibility on search engines.

## 🤔 How It Works

The application leverages a pure JavaScript/TypeScript templating engine.

1.  **Select & Fill**: The user chooses an NDA type and fills in the required details in a simple, structured form.
2.  **Generate**: On submission, the application merges the user's input with a robust, pre-defined legal boilerplate text.
3.  **Output**: The final, merged document is displayed in a clean text area, ready to be copied or downloaded.

All processing is done **client-side**, meaning none of your sensitive information is ever sent to a server, ensuring complete privacy.
